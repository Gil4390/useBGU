The following examples demonstrates how to rename a role.

Clabject 'C' of class 'A' has a role 'bb1' through the association 'ab1'.
We can rename that role to 'bb3', by adding the following line: 'bb1 -> bb3' under the 'roles' segment in clabject 'C'.
--> 'oldRoleName -> newRoleName' oldRoleName corresponds to the parent role.
