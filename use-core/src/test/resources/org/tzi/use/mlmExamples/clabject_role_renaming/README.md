The following example demonstrates how to define an assoclink.

An assoclink must be associated with an association, that both ends have a defined clabject.

Assoclink 'cd1' of association 'ab1', needs to have a role binding.
We can bind each parent role to the child role by adding the following lines under the assoclink segment :
'aa1 -> cc1'
'bb1 -> dd1'
--> 'parentRoleName -> childRoleName' denotes role binding.
    --> parentRoleName corresponds to the role of the parent clabject ('A.aa1').
    --> childRoleName corresponds to the role of the child clabject ('C.cc1').
